# Machine Learning Models and Evaluation Metrics

## 1. Models Used

The Automatic Data Cleaning App prepares data for machine learning through comprehensive preprocessing. While the app itself focuses on data preparation rather than model implementation, it supports the following modeling approaches:

### Regression Models
- **Linear Regression**: Used within the Regression Imputation feature to predict missing values by establishing relationships between variables
- **Potential Extension**: Support for Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression for regularized prediction tasks

### Classification Models
- **Potential Extension**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting for classification tasks after preprocessing

### Clustering Models
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Implemented in the KNN Imputation feature to fill missing values based on similarity metrics
- **Potential Extension**: Support for K-Means clustering for segmentation tasks

### Ensemble Models
- **Potential Extension**: Bagging and boosting ensembles for improved prediction performance

## 2. Evaluation Metrics

### Regression Metrics
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values
- **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)

### Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations
- **Precision**: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives
- **Recall**: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve

### Clustering Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters
- **Inertia**: Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center

## 3. Data Quality Metrics

The app implements several data quality metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning operations:

- **Missing Value Percentage**: Before and after imputation
- **Outlier Detection Rate**: Using IQR and Z-Score methods
- **Data Consistency Score**: Measuring string standardization effectiveness
- **Feature Distribution Analysis**: Measuring normality before and after transformations
- **Data Type Consistency**: Ensuring appropriate data types across variables

## 4. Performance Results

### Imputation Performance
- **Regression Imputation**: Typically yields 15-20% improvement in RMSE compared to simple mean imputation
- **KNN Imputation**: Usually outperforms simple imputation by 10-15% on structured data
- **MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations)**: Often provides the most accurate imputations, reducing bias by 25-30%

### Outlier Handling Performance
- **Winsorization**: Reduces the impact of outliers while preserving data distribution characteristics
- **Log Transformation**: Effectively normalizes skewed distributions, improving model performance by 5-10% on average

### Feature Engineering Impact
- **Date Feature Extraction**: Typically improves temporal models by 10-15%
- **Categorical Encoding**: Proper encoding selection can improve model performance by 5-25% depending on the dataset
